## Modules of note
### [unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)
This module provides a framework for constructing and running tests.
We deemed it necessary to maintain functional code as teammates made changes and as well as to guarantee our users a working project.
Teammates run/add to the the test suite to ensure additions to the code work. 
Our test suite can be run via the following command in the terminal:
```
python tests.py
```
